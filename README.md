Service workers enable graceful degradation for web applications. At first, the service worker retrieves and saves information from the internet, when the app can function at "max technology". Then, the service worker can provide this information when the same requests are made, even if there is no internet access. Thus, the app can continue to function even if some individual components fail, or "lower levels," thus giving them "grace".
